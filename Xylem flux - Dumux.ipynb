    "\n",
    "In the following we describe the code, that is used to solve Benchmarks 1-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DuMu${}^x$ we base the problem on the one-phase porous medium model (`porousmediumflow/1p/model.hh`) meaning there is one fluid phase (water) inside a porous medium (root). Hence, the root is modeled as a porous medium, where the root xylem is the pore space filled with water and all other root components constitute the solid matrix. The type of model is chosen by including the right header file in the problem file, with ```#include <dumux/porousmediumflow/1p/model.hh>```. Additionally, the spatial parameter class is derived from a suitable base class, i.e. ```FVSpatialParamsOneP```.\n",
    "\n",
    "### main file: rootsystem.cc, rootsystem_rb.cc (todo merge into one file)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compilation with make rootsystem, or make rootsystem_rb. Rootsystem uses a dgf grid file as geometry, while rootsystem_rb uses a static or growing root architecture generated by CRootBox. The main file is a typical Dumux 3.0 main file with the following extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We use TimeLoop.CheckTimes and only write vtk files at the check times\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The model is static and we always build a static model. But we use the simulation loop to use dynamic boundary conditions like a sinusoidal transpiration rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In case of a growing root system, we need to adjust the dune-foamgrid geometry, and update the spatial parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### problem file: rootsproblem.hh\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dumux Problem class describes initial conditions, boundary conditions, and sources and sinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the constructor reads all relevant parameters from the input file, in our case: Soil.IC.P, RootSystem.Collar.Transpiration or RootSystem.Collar.P; and optionally Soil.IC.Z, and RootSystem.Collar.TranspirationT or RootSystem.Collar.PT respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Definition of boundary conditions:*\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to choose the type of Dumux boundary condition in the member function boundaryTypesAtPos(...), and set it to either Neumann or Dirichlet. We make this decision based on if pressure or transpiration was defined in the input file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dirichlet boundary conditions can not be solution dependent. They are used for constant pressure top or bot (see dirichletAtPos(...)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Neumann boundary conditions can be solution dependent. We use this to limit the flow hat the critical collar pressure cannot be exceeded. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Definition of initial condition* \n",

    "\n",
    "*Sources and sinks*\n",
    "\n",
    "They are defined by overwriting the method source(...). We implement the gradient between root pressure and soil pressure. Soil pressure is determined by a callback function (so we can use this implementation for sequential coupling at later time)  \n",

    "This class manages the spatial parameters if a dune grid fild (.dgf) is used. The constructor reads all relevant parameters from the input file.All parameters are optional (since they could be passed via the dgf file). RootSystem.Radius and RootSystem.Age can be constant or given per root order. Root system conductivities can be given constant, per root order/type, by linear interpolation (age dependent), or by multiple tables of linear interpolation chosen per root order/type (see also dumux/io/inputfilefunciton.hh). \n",

    "porosityAtPos(...) must be overwritten, but model solution is independent of it.\n",

    "permeability(...) defines the (intrinsic) permeability $K$ [m^2] and must be overwritten. We convert the root axial conductivity ($\\frac{m^5 s}{kg} = \\frac{m^4}{Pa \\ s} $) to the intrinsic permeability by multiplication with the dynamic viscosity ($Pa \\ s$) and division by the cross-section area $\\pi r^2$ ($m^2$). The intrinsic permeability is a resistance coefficient that is only dependent on the root xylem and not the properties of the fluid (water).\n",

    "This class manages the spatial parameters if a root growth model  is used (currently only CRootBox, later also CPlantBox).
