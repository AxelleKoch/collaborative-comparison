    "The aim of this notebook is to define which scenarios will be used to compare root system architecture models. The main difficulty here is that we do not have a exact solution for the simulation of root system architecture. We can only compare the models between them and see wether we observe variations between them. Here, the idea is not to use pre-defined parameters sets for eahc model, but the start from the experimental data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmarking of structural root architecture models will be performed in 4 steps: (1) parameterize the root system architecture models  using a common set of metrics, coming from experimental data, (2) simulate a set of root systems for two different plant species (one dicotyledon and one monocotyledon) and different benchmark scenarios, (3) export and store the simulated root systems as Root System Markup Language (RSML) files, and (4) analyse the results using the pipelines available in the associated Jupyter notebook. It as to be noited that the following benchmark problems focus on root architecture dynamics modelling only, neglecting the effect of soil properties on root growth. \n"

    "## Benchmarking dataset description\n",
    "\n",
    "Two distinct datasets were assembled to form the root architecture benchmarking dataset. First, to analyse the capability of root models to represent the growth of dicot root systems , we analyzed images of lupin plants (*Lupinus ablus*) grown for 10 days in an aeroponic setup. Second, for monocot root systems, we analyzed images of maize plants (*Zea mays*) grown for 10 days on filter paper (pouches). for both plants, the images were analysed using the semi-automated root analysis software SmartRoot. The root tracing were stored as RSML data files for further analysis. For each root system, different type of informatio were extracted: summary metric at the root system level, such as the number of lateral roots or the total length of the root system, and detailed metrics at the root level, such as the lenght of each individual root, their insertion angle of insertion position on their parent. these two type of informations should help modellers parametrize their respective architectural model. \n",
