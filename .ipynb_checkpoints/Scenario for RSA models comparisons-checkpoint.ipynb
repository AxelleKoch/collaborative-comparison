    "The aim of this notebook is to define which scenarios will be used to compare root system architecture models. The main difficulty here is that we do not have a exact solution for the simulation of root system architecture. We can only compare the models between them and see wether we observe variations between them. Here, the idea is not to use pre-defined parameters sets for eahc model, but the start from the experimental data. \n"
